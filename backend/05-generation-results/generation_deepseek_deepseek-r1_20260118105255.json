  "response": "【思维过程】\nOkay, let me start by looking at the user's query. The user provided a context with two bullet points from Source 1 and then repeated part of the first bullet in the question. The assistant's response correctly restates the first bullet point from the context.\n\nHmm, the user's question is a partial quote from the first bullet. They might be checking if the assistant can accurately recall or summarize that point. The assistant did exactly that, quoting the first bullet point verbatim. \n\nWait, is there anything else the user might need? Since the context includes two points, maybe the user wants both mentioned. But the question specifically focuses on the first part. The assistant stuck to what was asked without adding extra info, which is appropriate.\n\nAlso, the user might be testing attention to detail or looking for confirmation. The assistant’s response is precise and matches the source. No need to overcomplicate—just direct quoting from the provided context works here.\n\n【最终答案】\nAccording to the provided context, the complete statement is:\n\n> We will consistently explore and iterate on the deep thinking capabilities of our models, aiming to enhance their intelligence and problem-solving abilities by expanding their reasoning length and depth.",
